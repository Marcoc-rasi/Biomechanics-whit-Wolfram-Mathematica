# Biomechanics-whit-WolframAlpha
This project takes videos of bipedal walking, and analyzes them with Kinovea. Kinovea returns us an Excel file with the position in time of the joints, we import this data into wolfram Alpha where we can do operations with them, graph, and compare the position of the joints in each walk.
